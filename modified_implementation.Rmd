## Preprocessing - superbowl winners
0 indicates that the team did not win the SuperBowl. For teams that win, the 0 is changed to a 1.

```{r}

## training/ testing data
Training: 2009 - 2014
Testing: 2015 - 2020
Validation: 2021
```{r}
#merge training data
training <- rbind(season_2009, season_2010, season_2011, 
                 season_2012, season_2013, season_2014)

#join 2018-2020 for testing data
testing <- rbind(season_2015, season_2016, season_2017,
                 season_2018, season_2019, season_2020)

#Validation data
validation <- season_2021
```

First few rows of testing data
```{r}
head(testing)
```

## drop unused columns
Remove the team name.
```{r}
training <- training[,-'Teams']

testing <- testing[,-'Teams']
```

## training size
Display the data imbalance for the Superbowl winners. Only one team can win per season so there has to be an imbalance to start.
```{r}
#number of rows that indicate winning teams
table(training$super_bowl_winner == 1)
```

## Percentage of minority observation
Only about 3% of the training data represents a SuperBowl winning team.
```{r}
sum(training$super_bowl_winner)/nrow(training)*100
```

## Oversampling for data imbalance
The original training dataset was 192 row. With ROSE, we are able to add synthetic data to expand it. Our ROSE training dataset is 1000 rows. ROSE also allows us to address the data imbalance. Everytime a row is added to the data, there is a 50% chance that the row will represent a SuperBowl winning team.
```{r}
#desired length of training
n_train <- 1000

#probability of minority class being generated
p_minority <- 0.5 #not bad performance for .25

rose_training <- ROSE(as.factor(super_bowl_winner) ~ ., data  = training, N = n_train, p = p_minority, seed = 412)$data
```

## New training table
Almost 50% of our ROSE training data represents a SuperBowl winning teams.
```{r}
table(rose_training$super_bowl_winner == 1)
```

## train model
We trained two models. The first model was trained using our original training data. It has 192 rows and 3.125% of the data represents a SuperBowl winning team.

The second model was trained with our ROSE training data. It has 1000 rows and 49.4% of the data represents a SuperBowl winning team.
```{r}
original_model <- glm(super_bowl_winner ~ win_percent + total_points +
                        total_rushing_yards + total_passing_yards + total_yards, 
                      data = training, family = binomial())

#Model with ROSE Training data
rose_model <- glm(super_bowl_winner ~  win_percent + total_points +
                    total_rushing_yards + total_passing_yards + total_yards, 
                  data = rose_training, family = binomial())
```


## Model Summary
```{r}
summary(original_model)
```

```{r}
summary(rose_model)
```

## test model
Adds the probability for the team to win according to the two models.
```{r}
testing$prediction <- predict(original_model, newdata = testing, type = "response")

#test ROSE model
testing$rose_prediction <- predict(rose_model, newdata = testing, type = "response")
```

This is the probability generated from the first model. Blue dots represent the actual winners. Most of the points are under 25%, including all of the winners.
```{r}
#plot for original model
ggplot(testing, aes(x = reorder(prediction, prediction), y = prediction)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = super_bowl_winner)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_blank()) + 
  xlab("probability") 
```

This is the probability generated from the ROSE model. Blue dots represent the actual winners. The points distributed a little more and 5 out of 6 of the winners are above 50%. 3 out of 6 of the winners are above 75%.
```{r}
#plot for original model
ggplot(testing, aes(x = reorder(rose_prediction, rose_prediction), y = rose_prediction)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = super_bowl_winner)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_blank()) + 
  xlab("probability") 
```

## AUC
AUC for the first model is close to flipping a coin at 65%.
```{r}
auc(testing$super_bowl_winner, testing$prediction)
```

The AUC for the ROSE model is a lot higher, which indicates better performance.
```{r}
auc(testing$super_bowl_winner, testing$rose_prediction)
```

## Confusion Matrix
Need to add loop for finding the best sensitivity https://statinfer.com/203-4-2-calculating-sensitivity-and-specificity-in-r/
```{r}
threshold=0.50
temp <- testing %>% select(super_bowl_winner)
temp$predicted_values <- ifelse(testing$prediction>threshold,1,0)
temp$rose_predicted_values <- ifelse(testing$rose_prediction>threshold,1,0)

original_conf_matrix<-table(temp$predicted_values, temp$super_bowl_winner)
rose_conf_matrix<-table(temp$rose_predicted_values, temp$super_bowl_winner)

original_conf_matrix
rose_conf_matrix
```

## Validation
```{r}
validation$prediction <- predict(original_model, newdata = validation, type = "response")

#test ROSE model
validation$rose_prediction <- predict(rose_model, newdata = validation, type = "response")
```

With original model, if a team tied, then it could not win the superbowl
```{r}
ggplot(validation, aes(x = reorder(Teams, prediction), y = prediction)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = Teams)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  xlab("NFL Teams") + 
  ylab("Predicted Winner") + 
  ggtitle("2021 Super Bowl Winner Prediction")
```

```{r}
ggplot(validation, aes(x = reorder(Teams, rose_prediction), y = rose_prediction)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = Teams)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  xlab("NFL Teams") + 
  ylab("Predicted Winner") + 
  ggtitle("2021 Super Bowl Winner Prediction")
```
